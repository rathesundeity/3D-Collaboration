# Ra Creations – 3D Print & Paint Tracker

This repository helps coordinate and track collaborative 3D printing and painting work between Robert and team.

## Structure
- `/models/` – STL and print-ready models
- `/painting/` – WIP and finished painted models
- `/docs/` – Shared knowledge, ideas, and resources
- `tasks.md` – Simple task checklist for prints and paints

## Workflow
- Add new model STLs under `/models/pending/`
- Move to `/printing/` once you officially claim this print
- Move to `/printed/` when done
- Once painted, move model to `/painting/finished/`

We use GitHub to stay in sync and organize upcoming projects.
