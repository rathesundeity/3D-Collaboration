# Ra Creations – 3D Print & Paint Tracker

This repository helps coordinate and track collaborative 3D printing and painting work between Robert and team.

## Team
- Robert W. Berwick (Resin Printer & Painter)
- Joshua L. Biggs (Resin Printer & Painter)

## Structure
- `/models/` – STL and print-ready models
- `/painting/` – WIP and finished painted models
- `/docs/` – Shared knowledge, ideas, and resources
- `master list.md` – Simple task checklist for prints and paints

## Workflow
- Add files with link to STL under `/models/pending/` send raw files over discord
- Move to `/printing/` once you officially claim this print
- Move to `/printed/` when done
- Once painted, move model to `/painting/finished/`

We use GitHub to stay in sync and organize upcoming projects.
The whole repository is subject to change. Not set in stone yet or more appropriately... not cured in resin yet.
